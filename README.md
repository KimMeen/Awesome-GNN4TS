Time series analysis is a fundamental task in many real-world applications, such as finance, healthcare, and transportation. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in time series analysis. This repository aims to collect the resources related to GNNs for time series analysis (GNN4TS).

时间序列分析是许多现实应用场景中的一项基本任务，例如对金融、医疗、和交通运输数据的分析与建模。近年来，图神经网络（GNN）已广泛应用于时间序列分析。本项目旨在收集整理与时间序列分析相关图神经网络（GNN4TS）的资源。

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/taxonomy.png" width="1200">
</p>

We provide two taxonomies for GNN4TS. The first taxonomy (left) is task-oriented and the second taxonomy (right) is model-oriented. The task-oriented taxonomy is based on the tasks that GNNs are used for in time series analysis. The model-oriented taxonomy is based on the types of GNNs used in time series analysis.

针对GNN4TS的大框架，我们提出了两种分类法：其一（左）是面向任务的，其次（右）是面向模型的。第一种分类法基于GNN在时间序列分析中施展的具体任务进行划分，第二种分类法则基于时间序列分析中GNN的类型与设计进行归纳。
